Analysis of radiocarbon incubation data testing temperature sensitivity of fast-cycling and slow-cycling carbon pools

Data used in this analysis are stored in the NGEE-Arctic data repository, and can be accessed at http://dx.doi.org/10.5440/1364062

Description of files:
(1) Delta_analysis.Rmd uses the Delta2 and Delta3 metrics to evaluate the temperature sensitivity of bulk CO2 and of slow-pool and fast-pool CO2
(2) TT_calculation.Rmd uses a time-dependent steady state model to evaluate 14C for specified vectors of turnover times, analysis years, and carbon residence times in vegetation.  Code can be used iteratively to model turnover time from radiocarbon data.  Model is based on Torn, M., Swanston, C., Castanha, C. and Trumbore, S.: Storage and turnover of organic matter in soil, Biophys.-Chem. Process. Involv. Nat. Nonliving Org. Matter Environ. Syst., 219â€“272, 2009.
